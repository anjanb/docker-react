Important Info About Travis and Account Registration
In the upcoming lecture, we will be signing up for an account with Travis. Since travis-ci.org is no longer operational, you will be redirected to sign up at:

https://www.travis-ci.com/

Along with this change, they have also updated their terms regarding free accounts and credits due to crypto mining abuse:

Because of this, you will need to select a plan after registering.

Select Monthly Plans and then the free Trial Plan. This will give you 10,000 free credits to use within 30 days.



After this trial period, the plan will expire. It is possible that you will not finish the course by the time the credits expire.

If you run out of credits, are unable to register for a Travis account, or, if you simply do not wish to use Travis - We have provided guidance to use Github Actions instead (scroll past the lecture video to see the featured question):
